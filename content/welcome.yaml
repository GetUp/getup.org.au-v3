heading: Welcome to GetUp!

  Thank you for adding your voice. **GetUp is a movement of everyday people who
  work together online — and also in our local communities** — to campaign for
  First Nations justice, climate justice, economic fairness, and a stronger
  democracy. 
   
  Now that we’re in touch, the hope is that you’ll join us in taking action when critical moments arise on important issues like fighting for affordable housing, replacing coal and gas with clean energy, tackling rising inequality, and uniting with Traditional Owners against fracking.
   
  **So, what does taking action look like?** It could mean showing your support for an issue by signing a petition or emailing a strategic decision maker. Sometimes, you might share important content on your social media or be invited to attend an online event or training. We also gather in protest, partner with policy experts to develop new solutions, and exercise our consumer power. The choice to get more involved is always up to you.
   
  **Here are a few of the campaigns GetUp is working on right now — you can click to add your name to any you’d like to stay across.**
