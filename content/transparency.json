And every dollar you donate to GetUp is used to build a more fair, flourishing, and just Australia.\n\n[View a real time snapshot](/about#in-the-numbers) of what our members are up to.\n\n## Annual Reports\n\n * [Impact Report 2020-21](https://cdn.getup.org.au/2865-Impact_Report_30_11_FINAL_PRINT.pdf)\n * [Impact Report 2019-20](https://cdn.getup.org.au/2803-Getup_Impact_Report_19_20.pdf)\n * [Annual Report 2018-19](https://cdn.getup.org.au/2761-GetUp_Annual_Report_FY2018-2019.pdf)\n * [Annual Report 2017-18](https://cdn.getup.org.au/2545-Annual_Report_FY18.pdf)\n * [Annual Report 2016-17](https://cdn.getup.org.au/2544-Annual_report_FY2016-17.pdf)\n * [Annual Report 2015-16](https://cdn.getup.org.au/2039-Annual_report_2015-16withdesign.pdf)\n * [Annual Report 2014-15](https://cdn.getup.org.au/1329-GetUp_Annual_Report_2015_V1_(1).pdf)\n * [Annual Report 2013-14](http://annualreport2013-14.getup.org.au)\n * [Annual Report 2012-13](https://cdn.getup.org.au/811-GetupAnnualReport_2012-13.pdf)\n * [Annual Report 2011-12](https://cdn.getup.org.au/807-GetupAnnualReport_2011-12.pdf)\n * [Annual Report 2010-11](https://cdn.getup.org.au/228-getup-annual-report-2010-11.pdf)\n * [Annual Report 2008-09](https://cdn.getup.org.au/143-finalannualreport200809.pdf)\n * [Annual Report 2007-08](http://cdn.getup.org.au/AnnualReports/AnnualReport2007-2008.pdf)\n * [Annual Report 2006-07](https://cdn.getup.org.au/144-getupannualreport200607.pdf)\n * [Annual Report 2005-06](https://cdn.getup.org.au/145-getup_annualreport_0506.pdf)\n\n## Financial Reports\n\n * [Audited Financial Report 2022-23](https://cdn.getup.org.au/2976-GetUp_2023_-_Financial_Statements_FINAL.pdf)\n * [Audited Financial Report 2021-22](https://cdn.getup.org.au/2924-GetUp_Financial_Statements_-_2022_FINAL_signed_and_combined.pdf)\n * [Audited Financial Report 2020-21](https://cdn.getup.org.au/2864-GetUp_Financial_Statements_-_2021_final(6573081.3).pdf)\n * [Audited Financial Report 2019-20](https://cdn.getup.org.au/2784-2020_Financial_Report_-_signed.pdf)\n * [Audited Financial Report 2018-19](https://cdn.getup.org.au/2709-2019_Financial_Report_-_signed.pdf)\n * [Audited Financial Report 2017-18](https://cdn.getup.org.au/2541-2018_Financial_Report_-_signed.pdf)\n * [Audited Financial Report 2016-17](https://cdn.getup.org.au/2339-2017_Financial_Report_-_signed.pdf)\n * [Additional financial information submitted to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters](https://cdn.getup.org.au/2269-GetUp_JSCEM_submission_06_Oct_2017.pdf)\n* [Audited Financial Report 2015-16](https://cdn.getup.org.au/2223-2016_Financial_Report_-_signed.pdf)\n * [Audited Financial Report 2014-15](https://cdn.getup.org.au/2225-2015_Financial_Report_-_Signed.pdf)\n * [Audited Financial Report 2013-14](https://cdn.getup.org.au/2227-2014_Audited_Financial_Statements_-_GetUp.pdf)\n * [Audited Financial Report 2012-13](https://cdn.getup.org.au/2229-2013_Audited_Financial_Statements_-_GetUp.pdf)\n * [Audited Financial Report 2011-12](https://cdn.getup.org.au/2231-2012_Financial_Report_-_signed.pdf)\n * [Audited Financial Report 2010-11](https://cdn.getup.org.au/2233-2011_Financial_Report_-_signed.pdf)\n * [Audited Financial Report 2009-10](https://cdn.getup.org.au/2235-2010_Financial_Report_-_signed.pdf)\n * [Audited Financial Report 2008-09](https://cdn.getup.org.au/2237-2009_Financial_Report_-_signed.pdf)\n * [Audited Financial Report 2007-08](https://cdn.getup.org.au/2239-2008_Financial_Report_-_signed.pdf)\n * [Audited Financial Report 2006-07](https://cdn.getup.org.au/2241-2007_Financial_Report_-_signed.pdf)\n * [Audited Financial Report 2005-06](https://cdn.getup.org.au/2243-2006_Financial_Report_-_signed.pdf)\n\n## Election Reports\n\n * [Submission to the 2019 Federal Election inquiry](https://cdn.getup.org.au/2787-Sub_83.5.pdf)\n * [2019 Post Election Report](https://cdn.getup.org.au/2711-GetUp_Election_Review_2018_19.pdf)\n * [2016 Post Election Report](https://cdn.getup.org.au/2181-Getup-Election-Report-2016.pdf)\n * [2010 Post Election Report](https://cdn.getup.org.au/146-getup_annual_report_2010.pdf)\n * [2007 Post Election Report](https://cdn.getup.org.au/90-GetUpElectionAnalysis-1.pdf)\n\n## Australian Electoral Commission Disclosures\n\nGetUp is a Political Campaigner, with the same regulation and requirements as political party or an associated entity of a political party, but we go above and beyond.\n\nYou can read GetUp's [political expenditure declarations](https://transparency.aec.gov.au/ClientEntity/EntityDetail?clientIdentifier=30343) to the AEC.\n\nThe Australian Electoral Commission has confirmed GetUp's independence from political parties on three separate occasions:\n\nFirst, __[in 2005](https://www.aec.gov.au/Parties_and_Representatives/compliance/AEC_Advice/Getup.htm)__. Then again, __[in 2010](http://www.aec.gov.au/Parties_and_Representatives/compliance/AEC_Advice/2010-nov-get-up.htm)__. And yet again, __[in 2019](https://www.aec.gov.au/Parties_and_Representatives/compliance/files/investigation-report-2019-getup-limited.pdf)__.\n\n## Donations Disclosures\n\nGetUp is a not-for-profit organisation — and we don't receive any funding from political parties or the Government.\n\nIn the last financial year we took money from 57,551 individual donors, making up a whopping 557,460 individual donations. 97% of these donations were under $100.\n\nOn the rare occasion GetUp does receive a large donation, they're declared right here on our website within 30 days.\n\nBelow are all cumulative donations over $10,000 for each financial year, for the last seven financial years. Donations which met relevant legislative disclosure thresholds prior to that can be found on the AEC website.\n\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<table>\n  <tr>\n    <th>Name(s)</th>\n    <th>Financial Year</th>\n    <th>Amount</th>\n  </tr>\n<tr>\n  <td>Estate of the late Geoffrey Lawson Hook</td>\n    <td>2024/2025</td>\n    <td>26,220.19</td>\n </tr>\n<tr>\n  <td>Barbara Semler</td>\n    <td>2023/2024</td>\n    <td>10,170</td>\n </tr>\n<tr>\n  <td>Estate of the Late Geoffrey Bond</td>\n    <td>2023/2024</td>\n    <td>124,511.89</td>\n </tr>\n<tr>\n  <td>The Sunrise Project Australia Limited </td>\n    <td>2023/2024</td>\n    <td>$40,000</td>\n </tr>\n<tr>\n  <td>First Australians Capital Ltd</td>\n    <td>2023/2024</td>\n    <td>$500,000</td>\n  </tr>\n<tr>\n  <td>Australian Communities Foundation</td>\n    <td>2023/2024</td>\n    <td>$50,000</td>\n  </tr>\n<tr>\n  <td>Lush Australasia Retail Pty.
