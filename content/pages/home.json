Worst of all, far-right group Advance has just surpassed 500,000 members – and it's growing fast.\n\nThat's why we've launched the Fightback Fund – a bold, people-powered plan to take on the far right. If we succeed, it will be the single largest fund in the country dedicated to confronting this threat head on, and building the future they fear – one grounded in truth, justice and equality.\n\nWe've seen what happens when the far right goes unchallenged – and we can't let it happen here. Not in Australia. Not on our watch.",
