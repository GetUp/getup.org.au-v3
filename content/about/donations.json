  "body": "Together, we’re not just heard—when GetUp speaks, power listens. We've won a High Court case, secured millions for mental health funding, compelled governments to begin cracking down on multinational tax avoidance, and united to win Marriage Equality. Every dollar you donate to our movement goes toward building a more fair, flourishing, and just Australia.\n\nYour donation will be used to fund billboards that get our messages in front of decision makers, hard-hitting TV ads in the lounge rooms of key electorates, and rallies demonstrating people power.\n\nOur Crew regular donors allow us to plan big, tackle bold long-term goals, and remain fiercely independent—free to challenge big money and party politics while staying accountable to the people who power our movement.\n\nYour voice matters. Your actions make a difference. Together, we achieve the extraordinary."
