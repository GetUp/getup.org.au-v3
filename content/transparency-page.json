Then again, **[in 2010](http://www.aec.gov.au/Parties_and_Representatives/compliance/AEC_Advice/2010-nov-get-up.htm)**.

In the last financial year we took money from 57,551 individual donors, making up a whopping 557,460 individual donations. 97% of these donations were under $100. On the rare occasion GetUp does receive a large donation, they're declared right here on our website within 30 days. Below are all cumulative donations over $10,000 for each financial year, for the last seven financial years. Donations which met relevant legislative disclosure thresholds prior to that can be found on the AEC website."
