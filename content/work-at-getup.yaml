benefits:
  - title: Purposeful Work
    description: You won't be pushing paper at GetUp. You'll be working to make
      Australia a more progressive society - to get government action on climate
      change and commitment to renewable energy, to get kids out of detention,
      to keep the budget fair to all Australians, to save the Great Barrier
      Reef.
  - title: Autonomous and Challenging Work
    description: You'll have a high degree of independence and autonomy at GetUp -
      if you have a great campaign or project or creative idea, run it past your
      boss, make it happen! Every day will be different and lots of days you'll
      be thrown curve balls and need to work out how to hit them out of the
      park.
  - title: Learn from the Best
    description: While you'll have autonomy, you'll also receive guidance and
      training from some of the best campaigners in the country, both on staff
      and in the wider progressive movement.
  - title: Flexible on Hours and Location of Work
    description: While we aim to work roughly 9-5 and from the office, we understand
      that sometimes you may need to work 11-7 or from your home.
  - title: Work Life Balance
    description: We want our staff to work hard, but we also want them to have
      fulfilling lives outside of work. We are committed to getting our staff
      out of the office on time in the evenings and offer six weeks annual leave
      per year. Study leave may be negotiated.
  - title: Parent Friendly Workplace
    description: We offer generous paid parental leave for both primary and
      secondary carers. And our flexibility on hours and location of work is
      useful for working parents.
  - title: Global Partners
    description: We are part of a global progressive movement. We teach and learn
      from the best international campaigners by regularly connecting - through
      conferences and secondments - with partners in Europe, the US, Canada,
      India, and South Africa.
values:
  - title: Member Driven
    description: The first question we ask in all that we do is 'what can members do
      to create change?'. Our members are enablers of change. We put GetUp
      members at the centre of all campaign strategies and tactics – they are
      instrumental to any campaign victory. We take our responsibility as the
      stewards of members' time and money very seriously. We are open with and
      accountable to our members. We are GetUp members.
  - title: Passionate
    description: We are lifelong members of the progressive movement. We are powered
      by a deep and abiding passion for progressive change, for resisting
      conservative forces, and for fighting injustice and inequality. We desire
      to create progressive change on the issues that matter most to our members
      – climate change, asylum seekers and the social safety net, amongst
      others.
  - title: Strive for Impact and Excellence
    description: We are impact-driven and strategic. Our success is measured not by
      number of members or facebook likes. It is measured by whether we are
      influencing discourses, debates and decision makers. While our work is
      ambitious, we don't dive down every rabbit hole. We pick our battles. We
      focus on strategic opportunities to build power and show power, with a
      strong compass of short- and long-term purpose. We do the best work we can
      because we know that we make the greatest impact when our work is
      exceptional. We work hard, smart, and have a reputation for excellence.
  - title: Derive Strength from Diversity
    description: "A diverse team, membership and movement makes us better at seeing
      and fighting injustice. Our impacts are strongest when informed by diverse
      perspectives. We invest in and champion best practice solutions to
      increase diversity and empower every team member. We take positive action
      to prevent oppression, talking candidly about barriers to diversity and
      supporting each other through these conversations. We acknowledge our
      privilege and use it for good, constantly asking ourselves: how does my
      work support diverse voices and leadership? How am I working to share
      power in my day-to-day?"
  - title: Supportive of Partner Organisations
    description: GetUp is one cog in the progressive movement wheel. We are humbled
      by the knowledge and talent of other progressive groups. We are thankful
      for the opportunity to work alongside them for a common purpose. We learn
      from them. At the same time, we recognise our privilege and strength, and
      use that to help other progressives. We empower the movement to do more,
      and do better, and we become stronger ourselves when we do. By acting
      generously and selflessly, we make our movement stronger.
  - title: Supportive of Each Other
    description: We are a team and we are greater than the sum of our parts. We
      depend on each other's talents, expertise and passions to achieve
      excellence in all that we do. We're never turfy or competitive because we
      are stronger when we work together. Everything we achieve is the outcome
      of incredible collaboration and ongoing learning. We always make time to
      lend a hand or to give advice, because we know that it increases our
      impact. We share in each others successes and mistakes. We make sure that
      our teammates are looking after themselves. When the going gets tough -
      whether it be when we've had bad news about a campaign, or whether someone
      needs support about something going on in their life - we've got each
      other's backs.
  - title: Audacious
    description: Audacity is our standard practice. While we manage for risk, we
      never accept 'it can't be done' or 'that's impossible'. We are always
      aiming higher, pushing our own boundaries and getting outside our comfort
      zones, in our pursuit of progressive change. We're willing to take risks
      to achieve our goals. We are pioneers in our field, trying new and
      ambitious tactics to achieve our goals. We dream big, we are
      groundbreaking, we defy limits and never shy away from new challenges.
  - title: Nimble
    description: We always have our ear to the ground to identify opportunities to
      be impactful, and seize key moments as they arise. We are rapid responders
      - quick-thinking and fast-moving. Our rapid response is always weighed
      with accuracy and quality, a balance we try to get right by focusing on
      impact. The complex, ever-changing Australian political landscape in which
      we toil often necessitates changing gear, shifting priorities or pivoting
      to move forward with the most strategic action. We are flexible,
      adaptable, agile, and prepared to go all in to get the job done.
  - title: Experimental
    description: We are always innovating and experimenting. This means we are
      constantly taking risks and facing roadblocks and dead ends along the way.
      We aim to fail faster, meaning that we do not hold back on ideas for fear
      of failure. Rather, we try them out and either succeed or fail faster. We
      constantly scrutinise our work in terms of impact and reflect critically
      on what we could be doing better. We encourage open and transparent
      process, inviting feedback and evaluation on our work from each other, our
      members and our partner organisations. We relish any opportunities to
      improve our work because it makes us run more effective campaigns. We are
      constantly learning.
