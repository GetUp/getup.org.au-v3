title: When I put my postcode in to your website to send an email to my MP, the
  electorate that pops up is incorrect. What’s going on?
section: Technical Issues
content: >+
  Since some postcodes cover more than one electorate, a very small number of
  people living in those postcodes might receive something that isn't right for
  them — we are sorry about that!


  If we have an incorrect postcode for you, please <a href="/contact-us#contact-form">send us a message</a> with your correct address in full and we’ll update our records.
