title: If you campaign on issues, why do you get involved in elections?
section: GetUp Campaigns
content: >-
  Elections give GetUp members a powerful opportunity to drive progressive change on the issues they care about. Elected representatives have a huge impact on what is possible in Australian politics. So elections are a really important opportunity to drive new change and fight for what we believe in. But GetUp doesn’t support or endorse candidates during elections – we campaign on the issues that matter to GetUp members and make these part of the conversation.
