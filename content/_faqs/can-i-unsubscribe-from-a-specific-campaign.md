title: Can I unsubscribe from a specific campaign?
section: Subscription Troubleshooting
content: >-
  Unfortunately, at the moment we don’t have a method to selectively unsubscribe members from particular email campaigns.


  From time to time, GetUp may email you on issues that aren't your cup of tea, but we hope you'll stick with us to hear about and take action on other campaigns that you care about. If you'd like to unsubscribe from all GetUp emails <a href="/unsubscribe">you can do so here.</a>
order: 60
