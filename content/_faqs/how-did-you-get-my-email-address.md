  GetUp only adds email addresses if a person signs up to receive updates. We are committed to protecting your privacy. You may have signed up on our homepage or by participating in a GetUp petition or action, which automatically signs you up to receive GetUp updates.


  If you do not remember subscribing, it is possible that someone else subscribed you using your email address. At the bottom of every email we send, there is a link to unsubscribe. If you feel you have been added in error, or would like to stop receiving GetUp updates, you can <a href="/unsubscribe">unsubscribe</a> at any time.
