  GetUp is a not-for-profit organisation and does not receive any money from any political parties or the Government. Instead, we're supported by thousands of individuals who may not have a lot of time or money, but who care about the issues and want to have a say.


  The vast majority of donors to GetUp give under $100, but some individuals and organisations give larger amounts.
