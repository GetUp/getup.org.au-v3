content: >-
  No. GetUp's work is driven by 1 million members across Australia. Together, we pressure, persuade and work with anyone in and outside government who can deliver real change on the issues that drive us, without ever giving or receiving money, or direction, from any political party, politician or candidate. GetUp's political independence allows GetUp to work with and critique all political parties without fear or favour.
