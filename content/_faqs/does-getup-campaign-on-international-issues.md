  GetUp does a lot of work that has impact beyond Australia’s borders, like advocating climate action and justice for refugees. But our focus is mostly on Australia and we’ve got our hands pretty full here.


  There are lots of other great organisations like GetUp all over the world. In fact, GetUp works with a growing network of progressive organisations in The Open Network – <a href="https://www.the-open.net/">check them out.</a>
